iPic could automatically upload images and save Markdown links on Mac. It's so free to insert images anywhere.

# Multiple Ways to Upload Images

iPic supports multiple ways to upload images. Let's look through all these ways and check which one is preferred in different cases.

## 1. Upload Images by Drag & Drop

Drag & Drop is an interesting way to upload images. Just drag images to iPic's icon in menu bar. The images will be automatically uploaded when dropped.

You may find that iPic will show progress in menu bar during upload, which is clean and useful.

Using this way, you can also upload many images at a time. The uploaded images will keep the same order with your selection.

## 2. Upload Images by Services

It's very effective way to upload images using `Services` in Finder. Just right click the image and choose `Upload by iPic` in Services, the image will be automatically uploaded.

Beside using context menu, it's more effective to use shortcut. Just select the image file and press shortcut of `Command + U` to upload it.

If you don't like the default shortcut of `Command + U`, you can modify it in `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services`. By the way, if you installed many apps on your Mac and there're many Services which you don't need, you can also close them here.

There're several other benefits to upload images by Services:

- Upload many images at a time.
- Even iPic wasn't running, Mac will launch it and upload images.

**Note:** due to the refresh mechanism of macOS, the upload service may not appear immediately after install iPic. Just wait several minutes or even hours, it will normally appear.

## 3. Copy Images and Upload

### Manually Upload

iPic will monitor the changes of system pasteboard. If an image was copied, it will appear in the `Pending` menu of iPic. If you need to upload the image, just click the menu item of it. This way is suitable to upload a few images.

### Automatically Upload

If you enable the `Automatically Upload` in iPic's menu, the copied images will be uploaded automatically. For example, when we almost finish writing a blog and just need to insert several images, this way is very suitable.

### Upload Screenshot

If you want to upload screenshot after taken, automatically upload is a perfect choice. It's very easy to do it.

Generally the screenshot tools have the feature to save screenshot to pasteboard. If you didn't changed the Mac's shortcut to take a screenshot, you can press `Command + Ctrl + Shift + 4` to save selected area on screen to pasteboard.

## Image Formats
